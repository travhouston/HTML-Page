        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>I am a self-taught front end web developer with knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and WordPress. I also have some experience in graphic design using Adobe Photoshop and InDesign. I have spent the last year teaching myself through different online programs the art of web development.</p>
        <p>I am hard-working, focused and determined to learn and grow as a developer. I am looking for an opportunity to put what I have learned to the test for a company. I am excited to begin this fulfilling career and driven to put my best foot forward in building dynamic websites.</p>
